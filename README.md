## Random Password Generator

### About:

#### This is a password generator that was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Using Javascript I have created a password generator that gives the user questions through system alerts, based on the answer that they provide a password is randomly generated. 

#### The user is asked to choose a length between 8 and 128, any response that is outside of those parameters will alert the user that they must select a number that is between 8 and 128 and returns them to the previous alert. 

#### The user will also be asked to pick whether they want lower case, upper case, numbers, or special characters. The user must select one or they will be asked to try again. 

#### One a password is generated, the user is shown the generated password and given the option too directly copy the password to the clipboard.
