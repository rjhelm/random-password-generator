## Random Password Generator

### About:

#### Per request, this web application will generate a random password based on user need. 

#### Once the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, prompts from the browser will ask the user to select a length for the password. If the user enters anything outside of 8 and 128 characters they will be prompted to enter a valid length. This goes for a blank field or any other value that may be input. 

#### Once a valid length is entered by the user, they will be asked to confirm the characters they would like to use for the password (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters). The user will select "OK" for "yes" and cancel for "no". If no character types are selected by the user, an alert will inform them that they must select one and will be given the option to select again. 

#### Once this is completed by the user the password will be generated based on the choices they made with random characters and it will display in the "Your Secure Password" field on the screen.
